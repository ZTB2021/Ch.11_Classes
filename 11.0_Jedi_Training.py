 1. Write code that defines a class named Animal:
     * Add a constructor for the Animal class that prints 'An animal has been born.'
     * Add an attribute for the animal name.
     * Add an eat() method for Animal that prints 'Munch munch.'
     * Add a make_noise() method for Animal that prints 'Grrr says [animal name].'''



'''
 2. Write code that defines a class named Cat:
     * Make Animal the parent.
     * Add a constructor for Cat that prints 'A cat has been born.'
     * Modify the constructor so it calls the parent constructor as well.
     * Add a make_noise() method for Cat that prints 'Meow says [animal name].'

 3. Write code that defines a class named Dog:
     
     * Make Animal the parent.
     * Add a constructor for Dog that prints 'A dog has been born.'
     * Modify the constructor so it calls the parent constructor as well.
     * Add a make_noise() method for Dog that prints 'Bark says [animal name].'

     
 4. Write a main program with:
